<title> Learning Java Programming Language </title>
<h2>

BACKGROUND

</h2>

<p>I started learning programming back in 2014 in SRM University, India.</p>
I was exposed to the following programming languages: 
Java, ASP.Net framework, C#, Linux and Unix

<h2>Features</h2>

Some of the general features of these programming languages includes:
<ul>
<li>They are all High Level Languages</li>
<li>Similar Libraries</li>
<li>Consists of tags and elements</li>
</ul>

    <th>Pros</th>
    <th>Cons</th>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
       <td>Consists of html tags</td>
    
       <td>Every open tag must have a corresponding closed tag else that line of code is seen as a statement</td>
    
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>Consists of html tags that are easy to memorise</td>
    
        <td>Color codes are not easily memorised except used frequently</td>
    
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>Consists of html tags</td>
    
        <td>Every open tag must have a closed tag</td>
    
    </tr>

Conclusion
</h2>
<p> Programming is quite an interesting task. However, it is best to be a master at one than having just but a little knowledge of all. Some programming languages have relational or almost similar library functions, so it is best to know and understand these libraries as it applies to a particular programming language</p>
